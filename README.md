# VENKATESH VEMULA
###### KALAKAND

Kalakand is a popular sweet made in **india**. it is made using ingridients like milk,sugar and some **dry fruits** if you want to make it special.<br>
 I like it because **it made by solidified, sweetened milk called Khoa**. It requires an effective reduction of the mixture to a viscous fluid, after which it can be frozen to solid and perfect to Eat and we can feel the taste of it.

#### Live script
> LiveScript is a functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript. It was created by Jeremy Ashkenas—the creator of CoffeeScript—along with Satoshi Muramaki, George Zahariev, and many others. Not to be confused with JavaScript (for a brief period in the 1990s, LiveScript was the name of JavaScript).
