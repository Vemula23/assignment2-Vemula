# VENKATESH VEMULA
###### KALAKAND

Kalakand is a popular sweet made in **india**. it is made using ingridients like milk,sugar and some **dry fruits** if you want to make it special.<br>
 I like it because **it made by solidified, sweetened milk called Khoa**. It requires an effective reduction of the mixture to a viscous fluid, after which it can be frozen to solid and perfect to Eat and we can feel the taste of it.
